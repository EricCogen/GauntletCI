Your tests passed. Your PR was approved. Your change still broke production.

Tests confirm existing behavior. Code review confirms intent.  
Neither validates what your change actually does.

**GauntletCI analyzes pull request diffs and flags unverified behavioral changes before they reach code review** — logic shifts, removed guards, silent regressions, and hidden contract breaks that pass tests and reviewers alike.

- ⚡ Sub-second analysis: no compilation, no AST, no network
- 🔒 Runs locally: no code leaves your machine
- 🎯 Up to 3 high-signal findings per run, no noise
- 🔢 Fully deterministic: 30+ rules, no LLM required

## Quick Start

```bash
dotnet tool install -g GauntletCI
gauntletci analyze --staged
```

Requires .NET 8+. Also available via [self-contained binaries](https://gauntletci.com/docs).

> Running against StackExchange.Redis PR#2995 — GauntletCI flags a swallowed exception in production connection handling.

## What it catches

A single line removed from a production service:

```diff
 public async Task<Order> CreateOrderAsync(CreateOrderRequest request)
 {
-    if (request is null) throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(request));
     var order = new Order(request.CustomerId, request.Items);
     return await _repo.SaveAsync(order);
 }
```

Tests passed. PR approved ("cleaned up redundant null check"). Shipped.

Callers relying on the early `ArgumentNullException` now receive a `NullReferenceException` deeper in the call stack, with no context.

GauntletCI flags it before the commit is created:

```
[High] GCI0003: Guard clause removed at line 3. ArgumentNullException no
longer thrown on null input. Callers relying on this contract will see
NullReferenceException deeper in the call stack.
```

## See it live — before installing anything

The [GauntletCI-Demo repo](https://github.com/EricCogen/GauntletCI-Demo/pulls) is a realistic ASP.NET Core `OrderService` with 6 always-open scenario PRs. GauntletCI runs on every one. Open any PR and read the workflow output:

| PR | Scenario | Expected verdict |
|----|----------|-----------------|
| 01 | Safe typo fix | ✅ clean: no findings |
| 02 | Silent `catch { }` around payment call | ❌ GCI0007 Error Handling Integrity |
| 03 | Hardcoded API key in Program.cs | ❌ GCI0012 Secret Hygiene |
| 04 | `CancellationToken` dropped from `IPaymentClient` | ❌ GCI0004 Public API Contract |
| 05 | Customer email logged in `LogInformation` | ❌ GCI0029 PII Logging Leak |
| 06 | Static counter mutated without sync | ❌ GCI0016 Concurrency Safety |

## Validated against real-world projects

| Project | What GauntletCI caught |
|---------|----------------------|
| dotnet/efcore | O(n²) performance risk (LINQ in loops) |
| StackExchange.Redis | Context mutation in property getter |
| Dapper | Null-forgiving operator misuse |
| SharpCompress | Numeric overflow risk |
| AngleSharp | Enum member removal breaking serialization |

## Add to GitHub Actions

```yaml
- uses: EricCogen/GauntletCI@main
  with:
    fail-on-findings: "false"   # advisory mode while you tune signal
    inline-comments: "true"
```

Start in advisory mode. Once signal quality is tuned for your repo, set `fail-on-findings: "true"` to block risky changes.

## Introducing GauntletCI into an existing codebase

```bash
gauntletci baseline create    # snapshot current state
gauntletci analyze --staged   # only new risks from your current change
```

Baseline delta mode means you get signal on what you're changing today, not noise from legacy code.
